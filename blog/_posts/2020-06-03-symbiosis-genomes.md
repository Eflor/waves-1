##Introduction to Symbiosis in AvidaEd
  - **Symbiosis
    - Symbiosis is the interaction between two organisms(Host and symbiont).
    - The types of interactions: mutalism, parasitism, and commensalism.
    - Organisms are genomes(Intsructions) in AvidaEd.
  - **Progress
    - Setting up organisms' genomes for Avida World
    - Symbiont mutating along with Host
##Project
  - **Empirical Library
    - Retrieved files to be inhertied for Header files for Symbiosis project.
    - Study AvidaEd related files
  - **Symbiosis Project
    - Header files for Host, Symbionts and Symbiosis world.
    - Declare and Define file functions to be used.
    - Make AvidaSymGP.cc file for Symbulation world.
    - **AvidaSymGP.cc 
      - Populate World with random number of hosts and symbionts.
      - Define fitness function for Host organisms.
      - Update World with given number of updates, default is 100 updates.
##Conclusion 
  - **Tips for future collaborators:
    - Do not try to skim through every file in the Empirical library!
  - **Biology side of symbulation
    - Learn the basics of the kinds of interactions between the organisms.
    - Experiment with evolution on AvidaEd to get a sense of visualizing the the problem to be worked on.
  - **Evolution
    - very complicated
  - **To be worked on by future collaborators
