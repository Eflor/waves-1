##Introduction to Symbiosis in AvidaEd
  - **Symbiosis
    - Symbiosis is the interaction between two organisms(Host and symbiont).
    - The types of interactions: mutalism, parasitism, and commensalism.
    - Note: Organisms are Avida genomes(Intsructions) to be able to implement in Avida-ED 5.
  - **Progress
    - Setting up organisms' genomes for Avida World.
    - Symbiont mutating along with Host.
##Project
  - **Empirical Library
    - Retrieved files to be inhertied for Header files for Symbiosis project.
    - Study Avida-Ed related files.
  - **Symbiosis Project
    - Header files for Host, Symbionts and Symbiosis world.
    - Declare and Define file functions to be used.
    - Make AvidaSymGP.cc file for Symbulation world.
    - **AvidaSymGP.cc 
      - Populate World with random number of hosts and symbionts.
      - Define fitness function for Host organisms.
      - Update World with given number of updates, default is 100 updates.
##Conclusion 
  - **Tips for future collaborators:
    - Do not try to skim through every file in the Empirical library!
  - **Biology side of symbulation
    - Learn the basics of the kinds of interactions between the organisms.
    - Experiment with evolution on Avida to get a sense of visualizing the the problem to be worked on.
  - **Evolution
    - The evolution side of this project is very intriguing because trying to recreate two organisms' interaction with each other is  
  - **To be worked on by future collaborators
    - Regularly check in with Anya to collaborate ideas for next steps on project.
